# StudentCareersSimulation
Simulation of careers of the students attending Msc in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Torino using real data and statistics from AlmaLaurea.

## Assignment 
Develop a simulator of the student career in the university.
 Q1. Explain the purpose of the simulator, i.e.. the main questions to address
 Q2. Explain in details the random elements in the simulated system
 Q3. Explain the main assumptions of the adopted simulation model
 Q4. Explain all the input parameters
 Q5. Describe the (eventual) open data sources adopted in the simulation
 Q6. Explain all the output metrics
 Q7. Describe the main adopted data structures
 Consider a realistic/interesting simulation scenario:
 R1. Motivate the choice of all the input parameters
 R2. Comment in details the numerical results, focusing on the questions described above.
